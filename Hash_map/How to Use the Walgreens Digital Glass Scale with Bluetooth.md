## Initial Set up for Automatic User Recognition with App
 
Before you use the scale for the first time, you need to install four AAA batteries in the battery compartment on the back of the scale. Then, you need to download the Beurer HealthCoach app from the App Store or Google Play and create an account. Next, follow these steps to pair your scale with the app:
 
1. Open the app and tap on "Devices" in the menu.
2. Select "Add device" and choose "Body analysis" as the device type.
3. Tap on "GS 435" as the model name and confirm.
4. When prompted, turn on Bluetooth on your smartphone and allow the app to access it.
5. Switch on the scale by briefly stepping onto the platform of the scale. The scale will display "0.0" and then "bt".
6. The app will search for your scale and display its name. Tap on it to connect.
7. The app will ask you to enter your personal data, such as gender, age, height, and activity level. This will help the scale to calculate your body composition accurately.
8. The app will confirm that your scale is connected and ready to use.

## Taking Measurements
 
To take a measurement, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your feet are clean and dry and that you are barefoot.
2. Step onto the scale and stand still. The scale will display your weight first, then your body fat percentage, body water percentage, muscle mass percentage, bone mass in kilograms, and BMI.
3. The scale will automatically send your data to the app via Bluetooth. You can view your results on the app dashboard or in the history section.
4. To turn off the scale, step off the platform. The scale will turn off automatically after a few seconds.

## Other Functions
 
The Walgreens Digital Glass Scale with Bluetooth has some other functions that you can use, such as:

- Changing the unit of measurement: You can switch between kilograms (kg), pounds (lb), and stones (st) by pressing the unit button on the back of the scale.
- Using guest mode: If someone else wants to use the scale without sending their data to the app, they can press the guest button on the back of the scale before stepping on. The scale will display their weight and body composition without storing or transmitting them.
- Using athlete mode: If you are an athlete or have a high muscle mass, you can activate athlete mode by pressing the athlete button on the back of the scale before stepping on. This will adjust the calculation of your body composition to suit your physique.
- Resetting the scale: If you want to reset the scale to its factory settings, you can press and hold both the unit and guest buttons for three seconds. The scale will display "rES" and then "0.0".
